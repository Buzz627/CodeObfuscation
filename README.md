# CodeObfuscation

## Brain storming
 12:00 pm
The first think I am going to do is create a test file in js so i can actually ru this thing
then read in the file and look for non reserve words that are not in quotes. so all the variables and function names. 
create a function that will create random strings then replace all variables and function names with the corrisponding random word

I think ill do this in python just to make it a little easier for reading the file and whatnot.
